# windows-executables
some of windows executables made by me can be found here.  
I make exes using C,C++,VB,C#,JS etc.  
I will soon make repositories for the source codes.  
To download folder-based applications, use the process listed below:  
    1.  go to **[Download Directory](https://download-directory.github.io/?form=MG0AV3)**  
    2.  next paste the url which might have the following structure:  "https://github.com/Chitraaksh/windows-executables/tree/main/<folder_name>"      
    3.  now should should be good to go.
